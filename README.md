# :blue_car: Drive Curve | Machine Learning App

This is a web application made with the help of Flask, a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2, and good intentions. On the backend, a Machine Learning model is used for predicting the price of the car. The machine learning model was trained on the Automobile Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
